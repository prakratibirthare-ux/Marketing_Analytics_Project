# Marketing_Analytics_Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end marketing analytics workflow, transforming raw marketing data into actionable business insights using Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization.  

Python was used as the core analytical engine to convert raw data into insight-ready metrics.

Data Cleaning & Preparation
Using Pandas:
Cleaned and standardized 100% of raw records
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Ensured numerical integrity across spend and revenue columns
Prepared analysis-ready datasets for downstream visualization

 Feature Engineering & Metric Creation
Python was used to derive business-critical KPIs, including:
Profit = Revenue − Spend
Average Conversion Rate (%)
Channel-level and Region-level Aggregations
These engineered metrics enabled profitability analysis, not just revenue reporting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Python, the analysis revealed:
A clear variance in ROI across marketing channels
Certain regions generating up to 25–30% higher revenue with comparable spend
Channels with high spend but below-average profitability, highlighting inefficiencies
A non-linear relationship between marketing spend and revenue, indicating diminishing returns beyond a threshold

These insights directly informed dashboard design and KPI selection.

Project Workflow
Raw data ingestion using Python
Data cleaning, validation, and transformation
Feature engineering for profitability and efficiency metrics
Exploratory analysis to identify trends and outliers
Export of clean dataset for visualization
Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

 Dashboard Components
The Power BI dashboard includes:
KPI Cards displaying:
-Total Revenue
-Total Spend
-Total Profit
-Average Conversion Rate
-Region-wise Revenue Analysis highlighting performance variation
-Channel-wise Comparison of revenue and profitability
-Scatter Plot (Spend vs Revenue) to assess efficiency and diminishing returns
-Pie Chart showing percentage contribution of revenue by channel
-Interactive slicers enabling region-level filtering and comparative analysis

 Region-wise Insights
Regional performance shows significant variability, with top-performing regions contributing over 35–40% of total revenue
Some regions achieve higher profit margins with lower average spend, indicating more efficient marketing execution
Underperforming regions present clear opportunities for budget reallocation and strategy optimization

Key Business Insights
High spend does not guarantee high revenue; efficiency varies widely by channel
Approximately 20–30% of channels contribute a majority of total revenue
Profitability differs substantially even among high-revenue channels
Data-driven budget reallocation could significantly improve overall ROI
